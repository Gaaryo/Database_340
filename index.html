                A tennis based sports website wants to enable users to find various information about past tennis singles tournaments. Every year the organizers of the Z.R. Tournament offer 8 of the highest ranking players a place in their tournament. If some players turn down the offer, the organizers offer the next player who has the most points. So, there are always 8 players in this tournament. Users should be able to find who sponsored a given tournament, who played in the tournament, and who was in/won each match. Users should also be able to find who coached each of the players.
